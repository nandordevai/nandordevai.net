The installation features a series of 3D-printed **data sculptures** based on climate data. An accompanying **AR app** made with **Unity** overlays a virtual data layer onto the camera view, displaying 3D models in augmented reality. When the center of the screen is focused on a model, an additional panel appears, showing the exact data points.

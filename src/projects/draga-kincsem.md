Dog-human “translation machine”: A **Raspberry Pi** connects to an online **speech recognition** service to detect whether a human is speaking into the microphone. It then “translates” human speech into barking sounds and vice versa — either by playing prerecorded barks or using text-to-speech to read stored sentences.

Made for the Public Art competition of the Ferencváros Municipality (Budapest).

Concept and installation by **Gabriella Kiss**

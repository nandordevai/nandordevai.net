“Kötelék”<sup>*</sup> **AR app** (made with **Unity**) and data physicalization for Petőfi Literary Museum’s permanent exhibition called “[To be a poet or not to be](https://pim.hu/en/exhibition/be-poet-or-not-be)”.

The installation features a data physicalization paired with an augmented reality (AR) application. The physical object visualizes individuals connected to Sándor Petőfi (Hungarian poet and liberal revolutionary), showing the type and frequency of their connections over time, year by year.

The AR app runs on an iPad. When you point it at the object, it reveals detailed information about each data point — including names, dates, and quotes.

The application was developed in Unity using the AR Foundation framework.

Concept and data physicalization by **Mihály Minkó**.

Hi, my name is Nandor Devai.<br>
I am a **creative and design technologist** <br>
with web and frontend background,<br>
working on **data visualizations and cultural projects**.

I work at the intersection of **technology**, **design**, and the **humanities**, creating projects that connect data, narrative, and cultural experience. With a background in frontend development and creative coding, I specialize in **data visualization**, **interactive media**, and **digital storytelling**. My work includes exhibition and [installation design](/projects/draga-kincsem), developing custom and non-traditional [interactive interfaces](/projects/pim-ar), and [data visualization](/projects/hvg-election), all focused on making complex ideas clear and accessible.

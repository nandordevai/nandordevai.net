        <p>Hi, my name is Nandor Devai.<br>
        I am a <strong>creative and design technologist</strong><br>
        with web and frontend background,<br>
        working on <strong>data visualizations</strong> and <strong>cultural projects</strong>.</p>

        <p>I work at the intersection of <strong>technology</strong>, <strong>design</strong>, and the <strong>humanities</strong>, creating projects that connect data, narrative, and cultural experience. With a background in frontend development and creative coding, I specialize in <strong>data visualization</strong>, <strong>interactive media</strong>, and <strong>digital storytelling</strong>. My work includes <a href="/projects/draga-kincsem">exhibitions and installations</a>, developing custom and non-traditional <a href="/projects/3d-print-ar">interactive interfaces</a>, and <a href="/projects/hvg-election">data visualizations</a>, all focused on making complex ideas clear and accessible.</p>
